## Background
Many women in Nigeria face overwhelming challenges when seeking support in abusive relationships. Cultural, societal, and religious pressures often discourage them from leaving their abusive environments. Instead, they are frequently told to endure the situation, seek guidance from religious leaders such as pastors, or rely on family members for support. Unfortunately, family support is often rooted in traditional values that fail to recognize the severity of the abuse. As a result, women are encouraged to remain in toxic relationships, with divorce seen as sinful or unacceptable, especially in religious and conservative communities. Women who choose to leave often face severe social stigma, with divorced women ridiculed and ostracized by society.<br/>

Furthermore, women in Nigeria are often judged harshly for being successful yet unmarried, as their success is deemed incomplete without a man by their side. This societal mindset subjects women to psychological abuse, reinforcing the idea that their achievements are not valid unless they are accompanied by marriage. This cultural pressure intensifies the struggles of younger women who find themselves in abusive relationships due to a lack of empowermentâ€”many lack access to education or jobs, and even when they do secure employment, they face domestic violence if they earn more than their husbands. This is just the story of 20 individuals who felt comfortable enough to share their experiences, highlighting only a fraction of the widespread issue.<br/>

Although some women access counseling services, these services often focus on repairing the marriage rather than helping women escape abusive situations. The counseling sessions subtly imply that the responsibility to "fix" the relationship lies with the victim, exacerbating psychological trauma. This approach fails to address the core issue of domestic violence, which is rooted in power and control, not simply relationship conflicts.

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of domestic violence against womwnt in Nigeria using primary data collected by the data analyst from womenn affected by domestic violence. The dataset covers information on victim demographics, reported cases and support gotten by the victim. The goal behind this analysis is to better understand the scope of domestic violence in Nigeria and its impact on the lives of women from different background.

## Data Sources:
**Domestic violence incident table:** Contains information about reported incident, loaction, age, support-service, type of violence and relationship with perpetrator.

**Victim demographic table:** Captures data on the personal demographics of the women involved, such as age group, marital status, education level, and occupation.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to perform an SQL analysis to: <br/>
1.Understand the support system gotten by these women after a violent occurence.<br/>
2.Understand the relationship between victim demographics (e.g., age, marital status, education) and the frequency or severity of domestic violence incidents.<br/>
3.Present insights that can support organizations and policymakers in designing targeted interventions and providing support to affected women.<br/>
4. Raise awareness about domestic violence issues in Nigeria.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis of this dataset collected from womwn in Nigeria, severral key recommendation can be made<br/>
**1. Adequate Support services for victims**
Special attention should be given to providing accessible counseling and legal support services to women exposed to violent attacks by their partners or family. ensuring that these affected women get all the support and assitance needed for them to move forward with their lives.
**2. Raise Awareness**
Awareness programs should be designed for women in different regions of Nigeria to ensure a high level of awareness. These programs should empower women to speak up to the appropriate authorities about potential abuse in their relationships, which can help protect their lives.
**3. Education and Empowerment**
Programs that focus on womenâ€™s empowerment through education and economic independence could reduce vulnerability to domestic violence. The analysis shows a potential link between education levels and the likelihood of being affected by violence. Encourage vocational training and educational opportunities for women to foster independence and reduce the cycle of violence.
**4. Collaboration with local organization**
Collaboration with local NGOs and community organizations can ensure that resources are effectively distributed and tailored to the specific needs of victims.
Encourage partnerships between government bodies and civil society to provide comprehensive support networks for affected women.
